# web-based-demo

my first web based demo contains basic HTML boilerplate, practice with canvas drawing, and gradients of colors.

Additionally, this project contains JavaScript functions that define player movement of an object, object boundaries, object speeds, and dimensions of the object.

Note: this project does contain some styling, but due to it's relatively small size, no CSS was used, and styling was kept in index.html.
